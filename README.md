## User Stories

- As a recruiter, I want to be able to quickly assess a candidate to see if they have the credentials and expertise requested by the client, so that I can determine whether or not to move them forward in the process.

- As a hiring manager, I want to be able to easily move in between the candidate's projects so that I can see how they approach problem solving in real-world applications.

- As a headhunter, I want to quickly identify people who demonstrate a potential for interesting work, so that I can see how they fit within the existing framework of my agency.
